# Real-Time IoT Task Scheduler

## Overview
This project implements a **real-time task scheduler for IoT devices** using **Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** and **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** algorithms.

## Features
✅ Supports periodic and aperiodic tasks  
✅ Simulates IoT devices interacting with the scheduler  
✅ Provides a real-time Gantt chart for task execution  
✅ Implements RMS and EDF scheduling algorithms  

1. Project Overview
Project Title: Real-Time Scheduling for IoT Devices
Objective: The objective of this project is to design an IoT-based real-time task scheduler that efficiently manages the execution of periodic and aperiodic tasks in a smart home environment. The scheduler will ensure optimized resource utilization and timely execution of IoT tasks such as smart appliance control, sensor data collection, and real-time monitoring.
Scope:
•	Implement scheduling algorithms like Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF).
•	Simulate smart home appliances and sensors.
•	Provide a user-friendly dashboard to monitor task execution.
•	Ensure minimal task execution delay and optimized energy usage.
Expected Outcomes:
•	A working real-time scheduling system for IoT devices.
•	Efficient scheduling of both periodic and aperiodic tasks.
•	A dashboard for monitoring task execution and performance metrics.
•	Simulation of IoT devices interacting with the scheduler.
